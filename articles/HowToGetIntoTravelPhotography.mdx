The photography industry and many travel influencers would have you believe that photography is a ridiculously
expensive hobby, and that the only way to take decent travel photos is with a top-of-the-line mirrorless camera
and full complement of lenses. With the prices of many new cameras easily reaching four digits, building a 
photography setup can be a daunting task, but I'm going to walk you through how to build a solid travel photography
setup without breaking the bank.

## Go Used

Luckily for us travellers and photographers with less deep pockets, the photography industry has a substantial used
market, where you can score some quality gear for seriously reduced prices if you know where to look. Whether
you choose to buy from a photography store or online, you'll get much more for your money by buying used gear.

## Choosing a Camera

When it comes to choosing a camera, mirrorless is the most modern and foolproof option. In a mirrorless camera,
light constantly shines onto the sensor, and the shutter is only actuated to control the amount of light that comes in
when you want to take a picture. That means that the "viewfinders" on mirrorless cameras are actually tiny screens.
This has some benefits, like showing more accurately what the final picture that the camera produces will actually look
like, but means that these cameras use more battery life.

Older style DSLRs are still common, and use a physical mirror to cover the sensor and reflect the image coming
from the lens into the viewfinder until you're ready to take a picture. That means that many DSLRs have incredibly long
battery life, but they are almost always bigger and heavier than their mirrorless counterparts. With most professional
photographers switching to mirrorless, it's not hard to find quality lenses for DSLR cameras on the used market for 
cheap prices, but you can use these lenses with mirrorless cameras too with an adapter. I'll recommend some
mirrorless and DSLR options so that you can decide which option is best for you.
