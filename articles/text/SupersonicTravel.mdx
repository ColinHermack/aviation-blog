The world achieved its collective dream of supersonic commercial flight in 1975 with the introduction of the Russian
Tupolev Tu-144, and the introduction of the famous Concorde brought supersonic passenger transport to the West a few
months later. Both jets, however, were retired within a few decades, with the Tu-144 being removed from passenger
service in 1978 and the Concorde being fased out in 2003. Requiring massive amounts of fuel, these aircraft proved
economically unviable. But several projects and proposals to bring back supersonic commercial flight are alive and well
in 2025, with some promising to make significant progress this year.

## NASA

NASA plans to conduct test flights of its X-59 aircraft this year, developed by Lockheed Martin's famous
Skunk Works division as part of the space agency's Low-Boom Flight Demonstrator Project. The goal of the project is to
develop a supersonic aircraft which produces more of a "thump" than a boom when going supersonic.

The aircraft is capable of cruising at Mach 1.42, roughly twice the speed of current subsonic airliners. NASA plans to
conduct flights over major cities in the United States, and collect feedback from citizens on noise levels.

## Boom Supersonic

Boom Supersonic is a private company which has developed a prototype airliner known as the XB-1. 
Though the aircraft is currently in flight testing, it is a one-third scale demonstrator, and much
more development will be needed before it is ready to carry passengers. Boom plans to conduct supersonic 
test flights later in January 2025.

Boom's Overture airliner is also currently under development, with plans to be introduced in 2029 or 2030.
The company promises that the airliner will be capable of travelling at a speed of Mach 1.7, and several airlines,
including United and American have already placed orders. The company has also received a $60 million grant from the
United States Air Force for further development.

## Dawn Aerospace

New Zealand-based Dawn Aerospace is developing a rocket-powered aircraft which will fly faster than the famed SR-71
Blackbird, while retaining the ability to take off and land at most major airports. Though the craft is designed for 
scientific research and defense purposes, the development of this technology certainly has exciting implications for
commercial supersonic and space flight.
