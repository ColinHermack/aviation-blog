The TSA is reporting that this past year had the busiest holiday air travel period on record. Delta Air Lines is also
reporting that increases in both leisure and business travel led to a better-than expected year.

Airlines have seen a much slower recover than other sectors after the pandemic restrictions of 2020, which ushered in an
era of virtual meetings and working from home which has not entirely receded. Business travelers are highly profitable
customers for airlines, since they are usually willing to pay more for tickets. However, business travel generally has seen
a sharp decline in the years since the pandemic.

While levels of leisure travel have recovered relatively quickly, business travel has not, and the number
of business travelers passing through airports is still significantly lower than it was in 2019.
In order to compensate, airlines have moved more of their fleet capacity to leisure routes, and are focusing more on
selling perks like premium economy seating to leisure travelers.
