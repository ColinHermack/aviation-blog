The Boeing 747, nicknamed the queen of the skies, has been an icon of commercial aviation since its introduction in 1970.
Once the most popular airliner in the world, most passenger 747s have since been retired, but aviation fans can still
fly on one of the few remaining carriers that operate the legendary jet in 2025.

The 747 was born out of the need in the 1960s for airlines to carry larger passenger volume which exceeded the capacity
of airliners that existed at the time. Boeing struck a deal with Pan Am to build an airliner 2.5 times larger than any
other on the market, and the 747 was born. 

Boeing suspected, however, that passenger travel would soon be dominated by supersonic airliners like the Concorde,
so they built the 747 to be the perfect freighter. The airliner's iconic hump allows its nose cone to open, making
loading and unloading large cargo easy.

So, which airlines still fly the iconic jet?

## Lufthansa

For westerns hoping to fly on a 747-400 or 747-8, Lufthansa is your best bet. The German flag carrier operates 8 747-400s
and 19 747-8s, and typically operates them on major routes between Germany and the United States. You can typically find
them operating between Frankfurt and New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Boston.

## Korean Air

Korean Air is the world's second-largest operator of passenger 747s, with 8 747-8s. You can find these aircraft
operating between South Korea and the United States, so be prepared for a long flight if you want to take one of these
flights. Air Korea typically operates their 747s between Incheon and Atlanta, Honolulu, and New York.

## Air China

Air China operates 7 747-400s and 747-8s, but operates them almost exclusively on domestic routes. For western travelers,
the only option is to fly between New York and Beijing, which is operated four times per week by a 747-8.

## Aeroflot and Rossiya Airlines

Russian flag carrier Aeroflot still operates 9 747-400s through its subsidiary Rossiya Airlines, but these are all
domestic routes. Given the current state of sanctions and travel restrictions surrounding Russia due to the ongoing
war in Ukraine, it's not advisable for any westerns to travel to Russia, so this isn't really an option.
