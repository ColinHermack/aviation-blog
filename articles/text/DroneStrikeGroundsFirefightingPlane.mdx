A Canadian firefighting plane has been taken out of service after it collided with a civilian drone,
leaving a "fist-sized hole" in the wing. The aircraft flew down from Canada to assist with fighting the
catastrophic wildfires affecting the Los Angeles area.

The aircraft, a Canadair CL-415, is a turboprop-powered amphibious aircraft capable of scooping 1620 gallons of water
from lakes and other bodies of water to dump on forest fires. It is one of the few models of purpose-built firefighting aircraft.

The pilots reportedly did not notice the drone strike, and the damage to the aircraft was only discovered
after landing. The FAA has stated that interfering with firefighters is a federal offense, and is punishable
by up to a year in prison and $75,000 fine. They also stated that nobody unaffiliated with firefighting operations
is allowed to fly an aircraft in the temporary flight restricted zones surrounding the fire ground.
