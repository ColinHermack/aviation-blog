The NTSB has now confirmed that data from multiple radar sensors and ADS-B indicates that the Sikorsky Black Hawk
helicopter involved in last week's deadly collision over the Potomac was flying at 300 feet, well above the upper
maximum recommended altitude of 200 feet for helicopters flying through the area. The agency also recovered several
large pieces of the CRJ700 series airliner which was involved, including significant portions of the fueselage
and tail. 

The board transported the recovered wreckage from the site of the crash to a secure location for examination.
The examination will reveal the way that the pieces of the airframe fractured upon impact with the helicopter,
and will also provide clues to investigators regarding the airworthiness of the aircraft and the state of its
instruments at the time of the crash.

Recovery operations are not yet complete and will continue today.
