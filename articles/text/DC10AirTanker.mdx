When fighting wildfires, dropping water or fire retardant from aircraft can be an invaluable tool for getting
the blaze under control. Helicopters and propeller-driven aircraft are usually used for this,
and carry 1-2,000 gallons of water. But, a few aircraft, based on jet-powered airliners or transport aircraft,
have been developed which are capable of carrying nearly 10 times this amount: the American 747 Supertanker and DC-10 Air Tanker,
and the Russian Ilyushin IL-76 Air Tanker.

Despite being the largest and mightiest of the three, the 747 Supertanker was unfortunately retired in 2021, leaving the DC-10
as the only widebody jet aircraft in use for firefighting in the West. So why was this airliner chosen for this role,
and what makes it so good for fighting fires?

The DC-10 air tanker traces its origin to 2002, when two fatal air tanker crashes during the same fire
season prompted the US Department of the Interior to begin exploring options for next-generation air tankers.
Many of the aircraft in use for firefighting at the time were from World War II or the Korean War,
and the crashes prompted a realization that more modern equipment was needed. This led 10 Tanker Air Carrier,
a New-Mexico based contractor which works on firefighting operations in the Southwestern United States,
to begin researching a modernized air tanker.

At the time, DC-10s were being retired from passenger service, meaning that they were easy to acquire on the used market.
The first DC-10 air tanker was converted from a passenger jet which was originally delivered to National Airlines in 1975,
and was first used on a fire in 2006. 

The result was an aircraft capable of carrying an impressive 9,400 gallons of water or fire retardant in an exterior tank,
which can all be released in 8 seconds. Despite this, because of the DC-10's size, the air tanker still weighs significantly
less than its maximum takeoff weight even when fully loaded with water. This means that the air tanker is able to 
maintain the manueverability and performance of a much smaller plane, even while carrying a load of water an order of magnitude higher.

The DC-10 was first put into firefighting use in 2006 against the Sawtooth Fire in California. Upon seeing its first two
water drops, a firefighter was so impressed that he remarked that the impact of two drops from the DC-10 on containing the
fire had been greater than the efforts of 12 helicopters over the past ten days.

There are now four operational DC-10 air tankers in existence, all converted from DC-10-30s, with an upgraded
capacity of 12,000 gallons. The original aircraft, a DC-10-10, has been retired. The remaining aircraft continue to be
valuable tools for firefighting. Two tankers have already been deployed in 2025 to fight wildfires in Southern California.
