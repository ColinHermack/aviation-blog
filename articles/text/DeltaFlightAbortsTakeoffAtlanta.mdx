A Delta flight was forced to abort a takeoff after an engine issue, the airline has reported. Flight 2668 was scheduled
to fly from Atlanta to Minneapolis, but stopped on the runway after aborting a takeoff. 

All 201 passengers and 7 crew members evacuated the Boeing 757-300 via emergency slides. ATC audio indicated that the tower
controller informed the crew that flames were visible from the back of the number 2 (right) engine, at which point
the cockpit crew made the decision to evacuate.

Four passengers sustained minor injuries in the incident, and one was transported to a local hospital for treatment. It
is typical for some passengers to sustain minor injuries when evacuating using emergency slides.

Atlanta was also experiencing severe weather due to a winter storm at the time of the incident,
though there is no indication that this was related to the engine issue.
