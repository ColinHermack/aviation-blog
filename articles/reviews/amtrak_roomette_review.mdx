Amtrak has several scenic long-haul routes that require you to spend a day or more on a train. With the roomette being
the cheapest option for a private room onboard, it seems like a great way to see the country,
but is it worth it?

In this guide, I'll share my experience travelling in a roomette on Amtrak's Cardinal route, give some tips for
those wishing to do it themselves, and tell the tale of how the trip fell apart and how I finally made it to my destination.

## What You Get

I paid $622 for a Roomette for two people on a 23 hour journey. This included the roomette itself, lounge access in 
our departure station, and three meals. We were also able to bring one personal item, two carry on bags, and two checked
bags each, but this is available to all passengers, even in coach class. 

Amtrak has a couple of other private compartment options larger than the Roomette, but I'd only recommend those if you
are on a particularly long journey. The Cardinal offers bedrooms and accessible bedrooms, which are both about twice 
the size of the roomette and include a private bathroom and shower. The accessible bedroom is similar, but it has a
larger door and more floor space (but less seating) to accomodate a wheelchair. While the private bathroom and shower
are certainly nice, the beds aren't substantially bigger than the roomette, and a private bathroom really isn't necessary
on a 24 hour journey anyway, so I'd stick with the roomette to save money.

## The room

While Amtrak describes the roomette as a private room, it would really best be described as a compartment. It's three
and a half feet wide and six and a half feet long, with two large and comfortable seats that face each other. 
Depending on whether you are travelling on an older Viewliner I/newer Viewliner II car (East of the Mississippi), or a Superliner (West of the Mississippi), there may or may not be a
toilet in the roomette, which is discretely concealed under one of the steps for reaching the upper bunk. All of the
Viewliner roomettes also include a fold-down sink. Roomettes on Superliner cars don't include a sink or a toilet. 

There is also an overhead compartment in the roomette to store luggage, though I will note that it's quite physically difficult
to get baggage in and out of there. Even as a physically fit, 20 year old man, it took quite a bit of effort to store
my carry-on suitcase. If you're travelling alone, you should easily have enough space elsewhere in the compartment to
store your luggage, but if travelling with a partner, you may want to limit what you pack or ask your attendant to
store your suitcase in the baggage car (I had a large duffel bag with me, and our attendant was happy to store it for me).

At night, the two seats in the roomette lay flat to form a bed, while a second bunk can be pulled down from the ceiling.
Both were fairly comfortable, but the upper bunk was very narrow which made it difficult for me to sleep with the motion
of the train.

## The Service

The first-class service on our train was excellent. Our attendant was friendly and polite. I was travelling with
a small backpack, carry-on suitcase, and large duffel bag, and he offered to store the duffel in the baggage car 
without me asking practically as soon as we boarded the train, which was very helpful. All private rooms onboard are
considered first class accomodations, so all meals are included as part of the fare. Our attendant would come to our
compartment at each mealtime to ask for our orders, and the cafe car staff would stop by about 30 minutes later to 
deliver the meal. Our attendant also stopped by our compartment at around 8 PM to turn down our beds for the night.

## The Food

The food on Amtrak will differ for first class and coach class passengers. While all meals are complementary in first class,
food is not included in coach class, so the only option that passengers travelling in coach will have for onboard food
is the cafe car. While the prices here were low, so was the quality. Hot food was mostly prepackaged and microwaved,
and many menu items had sold out 12 hours into the trip. 

In first class, the quality of the food seemed to be a bit better. While the food was served in plastic containers
reminiscent of economy class airplane food, the portion sizes were quite a bit more generous, and the taste was good.
Complimentary hot and cold beverages were also included with each meal. Unlike many of the Western routes,
the Cardinal does not have a dedicated dining car, so first class passengers will eat in their room.

## The Fall

On the first day of the trip, I had been impressed with Amtrak. The service was good, the train had run on time, and
the food was satisfactory. We went to bed somewhere in Kentucky, and planned to get up around 6:30 AM for breakfast in the
midwest. However, we were woken up at around 3:30 AM in a dark and cold train by an announcement from the conductor
informing us that our locomotive was experiencing a severe mechanical issue, and that we wouldn't be able to continue
the journey. Apparently, around 1:30 in the morning, we had attempted to depart from Cincinnati, Ohio, when the
locomotive broke down. We had to be towed back into the station, where staff attempted to repair the engine,
but were unable to. This was an especially serious issue since the locomotive provided power for the onboard heating
units, and the temperature outside was about 3° F (-16° C) at the time of the incident. We disembarked
into the unstaffed Cincinnati train station at around 3:30 AM, and we were told that buses would be arriving between
6:30 and 7:00 AM to continue the journey. The buses did eventually arrived, and we were able to leave Cincinnati around
7:40 to complete a 4 hour ride to our final destination. 

While a catastrophic failure of this magnitude is certainly uncommon on Amtrak, the Cardinal and many other long-haul
routes unfortunately do not reliably arrived on time, with only 51% of riders on the Cardinal making it to their
destination on time. So, travelling by train can certainly be a great way to see the country, but expect an adventure
and don't expect to arrive on time when you travel on Amtrak.
