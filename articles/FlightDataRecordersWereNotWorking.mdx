South Korean authorities have now stated that both the cockpit voice recorder and both flight data recorders (black boxes)
from the crashed Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 stopped recording data about 4 minutes prior to the accident. It is not
known conclusively at this time what caused the CVR and FDRs to stop recording.

Officials also confirmed that the pilots mentioned a bird strike and a go around in their mayday call to air traffic
control. ATC had also warned them of potential bird strikes prior to the accident.

The time at which the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorders stopped recording data lines up closely with the
point when the plane's ADS-B transmitter stopped sending data to satellites. While some have speculated that this could
be indicative of a complete loss of electrical power, there is not yet any direct evidence to support this conclusion.
