South Korean police have raided the offices of Jeju Airlines as well as Muan International Airport in the search for
answers regarding the cause of the December 29 crash which killed 179, [The Guardian reports](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/02/police-raid-muan-airport-in-wake-of-south-korea-plane-crash?CMP=oth_b-aplnews_d-1 "Read on the The Guardian").

While both flight data recorders have been recovered from the wreckage, work is still needed to decode the data contained
on the cockpit voice recorder, which could provide crucial information as to the cause of the crash. Officials also plan
to inspect the text messages stored on 107 phones recovered from the crash site, hoping to uncover clues about what
was occuring on the aircraft in the moments leading up to the accident.

The flight from Bangkok to Maun International Airport is believed to have suffered a bird strike on approach before
declaring an emergency and performing a go-around. On its second landing attempt, the crew did not deploy the landing
gear, instead performing a belly landing far beyond the normal touchdown zone. The aircraft was unable to slow down
upon landing and crashed into a concrete structure which housed the ILS antenna array at the end of the runway,
killing all but 2 occupants.

The only two survivors of the crash were flight attendants seated at the rear of the aircraft, who both sustained serious 
injuries. However, both were unable to recall events surrounding the emergency landing, providing few clues as to the
cause of the incident.

While Muan County fire chief Lee Jeong-hyun initially speculated that the cause of the landing gear failure was adverse
weather combined with a bird strike, the airport was experiencing nearly ideal flying conditions at the time of the
accident, and aviation experts have concluded that it is highly unlikely for a bird strike to cause a landing gear
failure.

While gear-up landings are extremely rare, a [Boeing 757 was forced to perform one in 2023](https://asn.flightsafety.org/wikibase/346271 "Read on Aviation Safety Network")
after it lost its left hydraulic system and alternate landing gear extension system also failed. A similar situation occured
on LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16, a Boeing 767, in 2011. However, the landing gear of both the 757 and 767 cannot be lowered using
gravity alone, which is possible on the 737.

Experts have also criticized the design of the airport, stating that the placement of a berm and concrete structure close to a runway
is unsafe. Placing ILS antenna arrays on structures designed to break apart on impact is considered the best practice for safe
runway construction.
