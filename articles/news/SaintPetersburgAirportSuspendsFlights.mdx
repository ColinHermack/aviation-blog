Russia's Saint Petersburg Airport reportedly temporarily closed at 7:45 AM local time on Saturday (4:45 GMT).
Rosaviatsia, Russia's aviation authority, stated that this was to protect civilian flights from harm.

Though the reason for the closure was not specified, other Russian airports have
closed due to the risk of Ukrainian drone strikes. Two drones were reportedly shot down in the
gulf of Finland

Russia's defense ministry also stated that 16 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight.

Rosaviatsia is now stating that normal operations have resumed.
